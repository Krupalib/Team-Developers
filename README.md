The cooking robot aims to make the process of cooking delicious food easy. One of the important aspects of making delicious food is recipe and cooking time. In this project, we aim to develop a web application that supports robot by providing pre-programmed recipes and also allows users to add custom recipes and share them with their friends.

 Objectives
Cooking robot recipe manager is a web application to be developed that supports the robot to follow through with pre-programmed recipes and allows users to create their own recipes. It is assumed that robots have the hardware to cook the food at the right temperature for the right time that is indicated in the recipe. Robots also have some utensils that will be associated with one of the actions in the recipe.

 

The recipes in the application will contain ingredients with their quantity and steps with the actions. Actions that cannot be completed by the robot will be completed by the user.  Quantities of the ingredients mentioned in the recipe will be according to one serving. Users will be able to enter the number of servings so the system will calculate the quantity of the ingredients accordingly.

 

Users will be able to add the recipes with the quantity (required for one serving), calories, photos, and cooking time with temperature. Users will be able to enter any new ingredient if required in the system. A rating can be given to the recipe in the application. Recipes will also have keywords to filter the search results so users can easily find the required recipe. Users can add their profile and share the custom recipes with friends using their email id.
